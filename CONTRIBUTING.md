Hey thanks for deciding to contribute!

The following is a set of guidelines for contributing to the imputations library, impyute, which is hosted [here](https://github.com/eltonlaw/impyute) 

1. Check for open [issues](https://github.com/eltonlaw/impyute/issues) or create a new one to discuss new features or bugs.
2. Fork the repo on [github](https://github.com/eltonlaw/impyute) and make the changes. Make sure you follow the guidelines below.
3. Write a unit test to show that the bug was fixed/feature works 
4. Submit your pull request and reference the issue (and add yourself to [AUTHORS](https://github.com/eltonlaw/impyute/blob/master/AUTHORS.rst)!)

### Development

This project was built for Python 3.5 and 3.6. (If you would like to work on extending this to other versions, that would be very welcome.)

Using [Sphinx's autodoc](http://www.sphinx-doc.org/en/stable/ext/autodoc.html) module, docstrings are used as the documentation. Make sure that all docstrings are formatted according to the [NumPy/SciPy Docstring Standard](https://github.com/numpy/numpy/blob/master/doc/HOWTO_DOCUMENT.rst.txt#docstring-standard)

Use [.pylintrc](https://github.com/eltonlaw/impyute/blob/master/.pylintrc) to lint files in accordance (mostly) with [PEP8](https://www.python.org/dev/peps/pep-0008/). You will first need pylint installed: [install pylint](https://www.pylint.org/#install). I recommend [integrating it with your editor](https://docs.pylint.org/en/1.6.0/ide-integration.html) or you can call it from bash with: 

    $ pylint --rcfile=.pylintrc impyute/

Fix all warnings raised, if you feel that the warning isn't justified/serves no purpose, then feel free to [disable the specific message](http://pylint.pycqa.org/en/latest/user_guide/message-control.html) for whatever blocks are causing it.

To run unit tests you will need [Docker](https://docs.docker.com/install/). The unit testing framework used is the built-in one, [`unittest`](https://docs.python.org/3.6/library/unittest.html). Put unit tests in the `test` directory in root. The testing environment works like this: 1) Build a docker image with multiple python versions 2) Run the container with pytest for each python version.

    $ make test
